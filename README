CS170 Final Project

The goal of this problem was to optimize an NP-HARD problem of deciding 
who would win in a bracket tournament given that A beats B, B beats C, E beats A, etc. 

This was accomplished by trying many different algorithms (brute force for small tournaments, 
gradient descent for larger tournaments, etc.) These can be found in main.py.
